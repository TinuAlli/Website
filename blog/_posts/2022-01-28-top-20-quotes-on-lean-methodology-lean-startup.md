[The Lean Methodology ](https://blackventures.org/blog/leanstack/2022/01/13/the-lean-methodology/)is a framework that has been adopted across industries to help in the elimination of waste. Iteration of the lean methodology includes Lean Startup, Lean Six Sigma, Lean Analytics, Lean Engineering, Lean Data, Lean UX, Lean Software Development to name but a few.

Here are the 20 top quotes on lean methodology/Lean Startup:

1. Lean Thinking provides a way to specify value, line up value-creating actions in the best sequence, conduct these activities without interruption whenever someone requests them, and perform them more and more effectively. - Lean Thinking, James P. Womack
2. Lean Startup is the application of lean thinking to the process of innovation. - Eric Reis, [Lean Startup ](http://theleanstartup.com/book)[](http://theleanstartup.com/book)
3. Lean is a way of thinking about creating needed value with fewer resources and less waste. It i is a practice consisting of continuous experimentation to achieve perfect value with zero waste. - [Lean Enterprise Institute](https://www.lean.org/explore-lean/what-is-lean/)
4. All kinds of wastes occur when we try to produce the same product in large, homogeneous quantities. In the end, costs rise. It is much more economical to make each item one at a time. The former method is the Ford production system and the latter is the Toyota production system. -  Taiichi Ohno; Toyota Production System: Beyond Large-Scale Production.
5. Continuous improvement is not about the things you do well — that’s work. Continuous improvement is about removing the things that get in the way of your work. The headaches, the things that slow you down, that’s what continuous improvement is all about. - Bruce Hamilton
6. Waste is anything that does not add value to a product, value as perceived by the customer. - Lean Software Development, Mary Poppendieck and Tom Poppendieck
7. For me, as for all Dyson engineers, lightness − lean engineering and material efficiency − is a guiding principle. Using less material means using less energy in the process of making things. It also means lighter products that need less energy to power them and are easier to handle and so more pleasurable to use.” - James Dyson, A Life
8.  There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all. - Peter F. Drucker
9.  A corporation is a living organism; it has to continue to shed its skin. Methods have to change. Focus has to change. Values have to change. The sum total of those changes is transformation.–Andrew Grove
10. Time waste differs from material waste in that there can be no salvage. The easiest of all wastes and the hardest to correct is the waste of time, because wasted time does not litter the floor like wasted material. –Henry Ford
11. The time is coming when every person who lays claim to ability will keep the question of waste before him constantly. The scope of thrift is limitless..–Thomas A. Edison
12. The lean producer . . . combines the advantages of craft and mass production, while avoiding the high cost of the former and the rigidity of the latter. . . . Lean production is “lean” because it uses less of everything compared with mass production—half the human effort in the factory, half the manufacturing space, half the investment in tools, half the engineering hours to develop a new product in half the time. - James Womack, The Machine That Changed the World
13. Startups that succeed are those that manage to iterate enough times before running out of resources.—Eric Ries
14. Waste is any human activity which absorbs resources but creates no value.—James P. Womak and Daniel T. Jones, Lean Thinking
15. If you can't describe what you are doing as a process, you don't know what you're doing. - W. Edwards Deming
16. The Most Dangerous Kind of Waste is the Waste we don't Recognise. - Shigeo Shingo
17. The message of the Kaizen strategy is that not a day should go by without some kind of improvement being made somewhere in the company. - Masaaki Imai
18. Quality is never an accident; it is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, intelligent direction and skillful execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives. - William A. Foster
19. Running Lean is a systematic process for iterating from Plan A to a plan that works, before running out of resources. -Running Lean, Ash Maurya
20. The Lean Startup is a new way of looking at the development of innovative new products that emphasizes fast iteration and customer insight, a huge vision, and great ambition, all at the same time.
