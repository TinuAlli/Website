**The Purolator 2022 True North Small Business Grant Contest** offers four Canadian small businesses an opportunity to receive $20,000 in cash and $500 in free Purolator shipping credits along with a new "pay-it-forward" cash prize of $5,000, to be distributed throughout their community. The grant is designed to help small businesses grow and continue making positive impacts on our local communities.

The **True North Small Business Grant Contest** is a great way for Canadians to express their support and gratitude for hardworking small businesses. As a part of this year's grant, the 'Pay it Forward' prizing will enable small businesses to do even more by giving back to their communities.

The grant contest was introduced in 2021. Combined with the 2022 contest, Purolator will have given back a total of $215,000 CAD in prizing to small businesses and their community members.
