In collaboration with **Google for Startups, Black Founders Exchange** is a curated program designed to move companies with a high-growth, scalable model from initial product to successfully raising seed capital with their business. Established in 2016, **Black Founders Exchange** — hosted by **American Underground and Google for Startups** — provides rich hands-on training, meaningful connections, and supportive community to help Black-led startups grow.

Requirements:

* BFE is specifically geared towards Black founders, based in the US, who are building high-growth startups.
* The founder must be an original founding member of the company.
* Each startup may send up to two team members. Each participant must be a founder or co-founder of the startup.
* BFE is designed for high growth startups in software, consumer product, IoT, Big Data, and other industries. Your startup must at least have a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and beta or paying customers. Preference is given for revenue-generating startups.

Benefits:

* There is no fee to participate in this program.
* The AU provides accommodation and many meals throughout the week. The participant is responsible for their own travel to and from Durham, some meals, and any personal or incidental expenses.

What to expect

* **Programming** — It’ll be a busy week! You’ll be in immersive back-to-back programming with your founder cohort. Get ready!
* **Mentorship** — We can do what we do because of our amazing network of founders, business experts, coaches, leaders, and Googlers that we’ve built strong connections with over the years who want to give back. You’ll be paired with a personal mentor to support you during your time here.
* **Community** — You’re not in this alone. Your cohort will be the folks who will support and root for you long after this program wraps. Lean on them during that week! 
* **Fellowship** — We’ve baked time in the schedule that allows you to explore Durham, visit some of our favorite spots in town, and taste some of the amazing food that makes Durham such a foodie destination!
* **Pitch Event** — What’s a full week of immersive founder-focused programming without a final pitch competition? Yes, you’re going to do great. 

**The 2022 Black Founders Exchange** will take place October 2-7, 2022 in Durham, NC!

Application Deadline: July 11, 2022
