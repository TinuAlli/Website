The GE Accelerator program is a start-up and scale-up acceleration program designed by GE Healthcare to empower and enable digital health start-ups and scale-ups to accelerate, validate and scale innovative solutions using GE’s unique Edison™ Digital Health Platform to address specific challenges to the healthcare sector. \
\
The Edison™ Accelerator Program began in 2019 in India, expanded into Europe in 2021, and Canada has been selected as third regions globally to launch a program in 2022.

Program Details

\- Participants will focus on three aspects of their proposition - innovation, adoption and integration. 

\- Participants will benefit from a combination of engagements with global GE experts from clinical, technological and commercialization teams. The program will enable rapid and compliant design, development and deployment of innovative applications and will ultimately give the participants access to GE Healthcare’s clients.\
\
In addition, the selected startups will have an opportunity to be considered for integration onto the GE Edison™ platform. Used by GE’s internal developers and strategic partners, the platform enables rapid and compliant design, development and deployment of various applications, and would ultimately give the selected startups/scaleups access to certain GE customers via Edison™ Marketplace, GE’s online store that allows customers to find, try and buy algorithms from a range of third-party developers.
