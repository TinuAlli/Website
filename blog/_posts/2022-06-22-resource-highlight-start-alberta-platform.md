**The Start Alberta platform** is a database for entreprene­urs, startups and the tech community in Alberta: find your right-fit investors, explore open job opportunities and events, research peers, or explore local accelerators and incubators. 

> **Start Alberta is the digital platform and gathering space for Alberta’s tech community.** 

Created by the [A100](https://thea100.org/), [Alberta Enterprise Corporation](https://www.alberta-enterprise.ca/) and the [Venture Capitalist Association](https://www.vcaa.ca/), Start Alberta is a comprehensive tech database in the province, connecting Alberta startups and investors.

**Start Alberta** was founded in June 2021 in response to the need for transparency and objective facts on the province’s innovation and tech industry.

Start Alberta provides a forum to share startup and investor content, press releases, investment deals, and events, promoting the Alberta ecosystem locally and beyond. 

Beyond providing a comprehensive list of tech deal flow in the province, the platform provides a critical forum for telling Alberta’s entrepreneurial success story and enticing investors both internal and external to Alberta to invest in what Alberta has to offer. Data partnerships developed through Start Alberta ensure startups gain international exposure.

Start Alberta combines machine learning and data engineerin­­g with user-submi­tted data with robust verificati­on processes and a strong network of ecosystems­.
