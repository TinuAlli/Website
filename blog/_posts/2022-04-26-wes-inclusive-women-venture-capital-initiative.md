Launched under Budget 2018, the **Government of Canada's Women Entrepreneurship Strategy (WES)** aims to increase women-owned and led businesses' access to the financing, talent, networks and expertise they need to start up, scale up and access new markets.

**The WES Inclusive Women Venture Capital Initiative** has been designed to provide non-repayable contribution funding to projects led by not-for-profit organizations to strengthen and build a more inclusive venture capital environment for Canadian women.

The WES Inclusive Women Venture Capital Initiative is a 3 year non-repayable contribution program totaling $15 million that seeks to strengthen and build a more inclusive venture capital environment for Canadian women.

It will fund projects including initiatives to strengthen the capacity of women entrepreneurs to access venture capital funding, contribute to increasing representation of women in the venture capital industry, or initiatives to reduce biases in the venture capital industry.

Applicants may only submit one application for funding. Projects must demonstrate benefits to women in the venture capital environment.
