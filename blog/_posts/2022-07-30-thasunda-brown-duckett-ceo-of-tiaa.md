**Early Childhood**

**Thasunda Brown Duckett** was born in Rochester, New York. Her Dad worked for copier manufacturing giant Xerox in its warehouse and shipping operations in New Jersey before downsizing at Xerox compelled the family to move to the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

Her parents used to tell her: 

> **“If you have strong character, then you’re going to do your very best. And if your best is a B, if your best is a C, then that’s your best.”**

When I worked at Fannie Mae, I immediately maxed out my 401(k) before I got my first check. That comes from understanding my parents’ story. My father worked for Xerox all these years and he only had a pension, which was like nothing. It was rough. I had no idea how hard it was for my parents until we talked about it.
