**The Government of Canada** has committed $200 million to establish the Black-Led Philanthropic Endowment Fund dedicated to supporting Black-led charities and organizations serving youth and social initiatives. Led by Black Canadians for Black Canadians, the Fund will create a sustainable source of funding to improve social and economic outcomes in Black communities.

To help meet these expectations, the Government of Canada wants to hear from you about how the Endowment Fund can be designed according to a “Nothing about us without us” approach. The Government of Canada is inviting Black-led organizations, charities and interested Canadians to take part in the call for concepts.

What the government wants to know:

1. How can the Fund’s philanthropic principles center the lived experiences and realities of Black communities, including in its governance?
2. How can the Fund remain accountable to Black communities and its governance reflect the diversity of these communities?
3. How should the Endowment Fund prioritize its investments and its granting?
4. What should we consider when selecting an entity or entities responsible for the Endowment Fund?
