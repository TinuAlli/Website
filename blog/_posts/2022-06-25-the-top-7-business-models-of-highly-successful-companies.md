A [business model](https://blackventures.org/blog/ideation/2022/06/09/what-is-a-business-model/) is a representation of how a business creates and delivers value for a customer while also capturing value for itself, doing so in a repeatable way. A Lean Startup is a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model. Getting the business model right and scaling it is a core function of the business owner.

> **A business model isn’t the same thing as a strategy, even though many people use the terms interchangeably today. Business models describe, as a system, how the pieces of a business fit together. But they don’t factor in one critical dimension of performance: competition. Sooner or later—and it is usually sooner—every enterprise runs into competitors. Dealing with that reality is strategy’s job. - Joan Magretta (Why Business Models Matter)**[](https://hbr.org/search?term=joan%20magretta)

Here are the top 7 technology business models of highly successful companies.

**1. Freemium Model**

Freemium is a portmanteau (a linguistic blend of words): "free" and "premium". Freemium is a business model in which a company offers the basic version of its product or service free of charge but a premium (money) is charged for advanced features. Freemium is one of the most common digital business models used by most technology companies.

> ***Give your service away for free, possibly ad supported but maybe not, acquire a lot of customers very efficiently through word of mouth, referral networks, organic search marketing, etc, then offer premium priced value added services or an enhanced version of your service to your customer base.* - Fred Wilson ([The Freemium Business Model)](https://avc.com/2006/03/the_freemium_bu/)**

**In his book,** [Free: The Future of a Radical Price](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6150530-free), former editor-in-chief of Wired magazine Chris Anderson highlighted 50 business models built on free. Here are some great freemium business models:

FREEMIUM (SOME CUSTOMERS SUBSIDIZE THE OTHERS)

* Give away computer-to-computer calls, sell computer-to-phone calls (Skype)
* Give away free photo-sharing services, charge for additional storage space (Flickr)
* Give away demo software, charge for the full version
  (most video games, which will allow you to play the first few levels to see if it’s for you)
* Give away Web content, sell printed content (everything from magazines to books)

More examples of Freemium Business Model: Google, WordPress, Dropbox, Evernote, Hashicorp, Spotify, Mailchimp.

**2. Free Ad Supported Model**

In a free ad supported model, you give away content for free and sell access to advertisers. To monetise your content, you host adverts from other brands and you leverage the eyeballs from your audience to gain traction.

* Give away content, sell information about the consumers (Practice Fusion)
