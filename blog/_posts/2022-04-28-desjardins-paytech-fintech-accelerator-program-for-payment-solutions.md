Startup in Residence and its partners understand the legal, technical and development challenges that entrepreneurs building practical, fast and secure payment solutions can face. The program’s goal is to support these entrepreneurs so they can go further and be ready for the venture capital stage to speed up their growth in a big way.

**With Real time payments set to roll out in Canada in 2023, financial institutions and fintech companies are constantly looking for new ways to provide top quality products and services that are instant and secure.

*  Businesses are starting to use online transfers more and more and this payment method is growing 50% faster than any other



**The targeted startups must have solutions that improve Canadians’ payment experience.  Some of the priorities are focused on:**
