[Procurement Assistance Canada’s coaching service](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-services-procurement/news/2022/05/government-of-canada-launches-new-coaching-service-to-increase-supplier-diversity-in-federal-procurement.html) provides personalized assistance to businesses owned or led by diverse groups who have had limited success bidding on federal government opportunities.

PSPC’s coaching service was designed as a permanent addition to Procurement Assistance Canada’s service offering that goes beyond its existing outreach services. The objective of the service is to help experienced bidders from diverse socio-economic groups across Canada address some of the most commonly perceived barriers in procurement.

The coaching service includes:

* An introductory meeting with a coach to review the procurement process and prepare for coaching discussions;
* 3 hours of one-on-one coaching;
* Personalized assistance to address the specific areas of bidding where your business requires additional support;
* Activities and discussion to address the most common questions from unsuccessful bidders: how to find the best opportunities for your business, how to create compliant bids, how to create a custom bidding roadmap for your business, how to create a bidding template from the solicitation documents; and,
* A participant guide with bidding resources and tools.

Participation criteria

Participating businesses must meet the following eligibility criteria:

1. Your business is at least 51% owned or managed by an equity-deserving group (Indigenous, LGBTQ2S+, persons with disabilities, racialized communities, and women);
2. Your business has previously bid on federal government opportunities with limited success (e.g. 3 or fewer contracts in the past 3 years);
3. Your business has a [Procurement Business Number (PBN)](https://buyandsell.gc.ca/for-businesses/selling-to-the-government-of-canada/register-as-a-supplier#600); and,
4. Your business intends to bid on future federal **tender** opportunities.*

\*Exclusions: The coaching service does not apply to businesses who submit primarily through Professional Services systems: Centralized Professionals Services Solution (CPSS), Task and Solutions Professional Services (TSPS), Task-Based Informatics Professional Services (TBIPS), Temporary Help Services (THS). Also excluded: Directory of linguistic services suppliers - Translation Bureau and SELECT (Construction, Engineering and Architecture).

## Application process

Applying for coaching is a short two-step process:

1. You will complete a brief set of screening questions to determine if your business meets the eligibility criteria for coaching.
2. If your business is eligible, you will be invited to continue to the application form.
