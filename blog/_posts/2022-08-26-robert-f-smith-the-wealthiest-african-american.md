**Early Life**

Robert Frederick Smith was born on December 1, 1962, in Denver, Colorado. Both of his parents earned PhDs and worked as teachers before becoming high school principals. As a high school junior, he applied for a **summer internship at Bell Labs** but was told that only college students would be considered. Smith persisted by calling the company every week for five months, and his tenacity paid off: When a student did not show up in June, Smith got the spot.

As an infant, Smith followed his mum to the **[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom,](https://www.loc.gov/collections/civil-rights-history-project/articles-and-essays/the-march-on-washington/)** where 250,000 people gathered to draw attention to continuing challenges and inequalities faced by African Americans a century after emancipation. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his now iconic "I Have a Dream" speech at the August 1963 event.
