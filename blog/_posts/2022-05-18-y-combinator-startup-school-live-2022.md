[Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/announcing-startup-school-2022) have announced the registration for [Startup School 2022](https://startupschool.org/), a live, online course where YC Group Partners and successful YC founders teach you how to build a billion dollar company. It will be the first Startup School course to feature in-person meetups and talks in over a hundred cities around the world.

**The YC Startup School 2022 course** will run for **7 weeks** from **Monday, June 27th** to **Wednesday, August 10th**.

For the last three years, the YC Startup School have been run remotely as a result of the global pandemic. The last live Startup School was in the summer of 2019 before COVID-19.

Application Requirements

* The 7 week course will begin June 27, 2022. 
* It’s free and open to everyone. 
* You don’t need to have a startup or a startup idea yet; Startup School is the perfect place to find one.

  Program Details:
* Talks from some of YC’s most successful founders, including Amjad and Haya Masad from [Replit](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/replit) and Blake Scholl from [Boom](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/boom). For the first time, these talks will be hosted live on Zoom, so participants can ask questions and interact with the speakers.
* Founder Tracks: 

  * 1. Aspiring founders track (Founders who don’t have an idea yet and are just exploring doing a startup.)
    2. Active founders track (Founders who already had an idea and were actively working on a startup.)
* Integration of YC's [co-founder matching site](https://ycombinator.com/cofounder-matching) into the course. YC runs the world’s largest co-founder matching site, with over 30,000 founders and 70,000 matches made. If you’re looking for a co-founder, it’s the best place to go. During the course, YC will host many meetups and speed-dating events for people looking to meet potential cofounders.
* For the first time, YC will facilitate hundreds of in-person meetups and talks in dozens of cities around the world.

  Some of the most successful YC alumni will host large-scale, 100+ person meetups at their offices. Each meetup will include a talk by the founders on how they built the company, followed by a networking session where you can meet the company founders and each other.

Here are the confirmed talks at YC alumni offices in 30 cities; more talks to be added soon. Note that access to these meetups is subject to capacity limits and dependent on local covid conditions:
