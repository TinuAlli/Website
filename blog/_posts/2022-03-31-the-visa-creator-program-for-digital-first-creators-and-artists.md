**The Visa Creator Program** is a one-year immersion program geared towards entrepreneurs working in art, music, fashion and film looking to accelerate their small business through **NFTs.** 

The goal of the **Visa Creator Program** is to bring together a global cohort of digital creators and empower them through product strategy mentorship. The Visa Creator Program is global and all interested creators are invited to learn more and submit their information for consideration to be part of the Visa Creator Program.

This **inaugural class** is for digital-first creators and artists who are engaging with NFTs and blockchain technologies in their businesses.

Benefits\
Selected creators will join a cohort-driven program designed to build and deepen their fluency in crypto commerce and traditional payments. The program is focused on supporting creators in five key areas: 

* Join a community of creators in various stages of their NFT journey.
* Mentorship with Visa’s team of crypto product and strategy leaders
* Work with thought leaders across digital commerce, web3, crypto and payments.
* Opportunities to engage with Visa’s network of clients and partners.
* One-time stipend to help creators kick-start the next phase of growth.  

The Visa Creator Program is part of Visa’s ongoing efforts to help small and micro businesses gain greater access to the digital economy. Through community-based initiatives like the Visa Creator Program and [She’s Next](https://blackventures.org/blog/startup%20funding/2022/02/21/visa-canada-shes-next-grant-program-2022-for-canadian-women-entrepreneurs/), Visa is focused on digitally enabling small and micro businesses through opportunities to access funding, resources and expertise. 

The Visa Creator Program is global and all interested creators are invited to learn more and submit their information for consideration to be part of the Visa Creator Program. We will contact potential candidates and announce the final class later this year. 

Application Deadline:

The deadline to express interest in the program is Wednesday, May 11th, 2022.
