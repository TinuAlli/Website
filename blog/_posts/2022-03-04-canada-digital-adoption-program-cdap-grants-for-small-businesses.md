In Budget 2021, the Government of Canada announced the $4 billion Canada Digital Adoption Program (CDAP) to help get your business online, give your e-commerce presence a boost or help digitalize your business's operations.

CDAP provides funding and support to businesses, as well as training and work opportunities for young Canadians.
