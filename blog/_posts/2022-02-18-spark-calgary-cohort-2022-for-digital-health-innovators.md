**SPARK Calgary** is a one-year program supporting evidence-based digital health innovations within the **University of Calgary** and other local academic institutions.  SPARK is based within [W21C Research & Innovation Centre](https://www.w21c.org/) and supported by [Innovate Calgary](https://innovatecalgary.com/). The program is directed by [Dr. Scott Kraft, MD,](https://www.w21c.org/rdy_team/dr-scott-kraft-md/) and managed by [Nicola Quiggin](https://www.w21c.org/rdy_team/nicola-quiggin/). It is currently being conducted remotely, over Zoom.

The goal of SPARK is to advance evidence-based digital health innovations to increase their chance of impact for patients in clinical and community settings. We respect that each participant’s pathway and the barriers they face in the innovation ecosystem are unique.
