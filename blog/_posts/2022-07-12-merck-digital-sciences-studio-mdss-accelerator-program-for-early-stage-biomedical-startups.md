Merck known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, has [announced ](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-the-launch-of-the-merck-digital-sciences-studio-to-help-healthcare-startups-quickly-bring-their-innovations-to-market/)the launch of the **Merck Digital Sciences Studio (MDSS)** to enable the generation of innovative technologies for drug discovery and development. 

The **Merck Digital Sciences Studio (MDSS)** is a 10-month hands-on accelerator program providing mentorship, coaching, training, support, community and investment in digital health and biotech startups

Merck welcomes applications for 12 spots for the first MDSS cohort. Startups developing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications will be prioritized.

The MDSS is a collaboration between Merck and the New Jersey Innovation Institute (NJII), a New Jersey Institute of Technology corporation, with investments from the **Merck Global Health Innovation Fund, Northpond Ventures and McKesson Ventures.** Technology support will be provided by Microsoft for Startups. 

MDSS will support early-stage biomedical startups with direct investment, access to powerful Azure Cloud computing and opportunities to pilot their technologies in collaboration with discovery and clinical scientists at Merck. 

Benefits

*  $150,000 in convertible notes and access to Microsoft's Founders Hub resources, including up to $150,000 in Azure compute credits.
* MDSS’ unique design and network empowers startups to engage with industry-leading partners, who take an active role in development.

**MDSS Program Details**

**Workshops**

No lectures. We work with founders to explore, discuss, and implement startup-building best practices.

**Mentorship**

Each portfolio company is matched with a mentorship team; one MDSS staff and at least one specialist from our corporate partners. These mentors work with their assigned company through the program and are trained on how to best support startup founders.

**Expert Coaching**

Aligning with sprint programming and workshops, MDSS brings in experts, thought leaders, and service providers to provide support to founders in the areas they need.

**Community**

Perhaps more important than any other aspect of the programming is the community of support MDSS builds among its cohorts and alumni investments. Cross-collaboration between founders and social events are built into the fabric of MDSS.

Participating companies are provided access to Merck for pilots, where appropriate.

Timeline:

* Applications close September 1, 2022
* Accelerator begins October 2022
