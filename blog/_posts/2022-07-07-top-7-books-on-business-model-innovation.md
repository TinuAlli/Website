Figuring out a scalable and repeatable business model is one of the primary functions of a startup. Having a business model is not enough but having a well-thought-out strategy is the key to winning in the marketplace. Every business model would be copied eventually but what is hard to copy is your competitive edge and strategy.

> **A Lean Startup is a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.** 

Here are seven great books on business model generation and Innovation

1. **Business Model Generation: A Handbook for Visionaries, Game Changers, and Challengers by Alexander Osterwalder and  Yves Pigneur**

Blue ocean strategy challenges companies to break out of the red ocean of bloody competition by creating uncontested market space that makes the competition irrelevant. Instead of dividing up existing—and often shrinking—demand and benchmarking competitors, blue ocean strategy is about growing demand and breaking away from the competition.

> **Blue ocean strategy shows how strategy can shape structure in an organization’s favor to create new market space. It is based on the view that market boundaries and industry structure are not given and can be reconstructed by the actions and beliefs of industry players.**\
