At the core of the lean startup methodology is the search for a business model. A lean startup is defined as a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model. Established companies execute their business model while startups are designed to search for one.

[The Lean Startup](https://blackventures.org/blog/leanstack/2022/01/14/the-lean-startup/) approach relies on “validated learning,” rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want.

One of the five principles of the lean startup is validated learning. Most startups start with a series of untested hypotheses (good guesses). The business model canvas is a tool where founders can summarize their hypotheses in a framework.

Each component of the business model contains a series of hypotheses that you need to test.

> **“The Business Model Canvas visually simplifies the reality of an enterprise with all its processes, structures, and systems.”**

[The **Business Model Canvas**](http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas.) is a visual business tool for documenting and developing business models. The visual chart describes a firm's value proposition, infrastructure, revenue and cost structure, customer relationship and finances. The canvas resembles a painter’s canvas—preformatted with the nine blocks—which allows you to paint pictures of new or existing business models.

 [The Business Model Canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com/expertise/business-models) provides an organized way to lay out your assumptions about not only the key resources and key activities of your value chain, but also your value proposition, customer relationships, channels, customer segments, cost structures, and revenue streams. It assists companies in aligning their activities by illustrating potential trade-offs by comparing them to one another and being able to see the bigger picture of their overall business framework

The business model canvas template was popularized by Swiss business theorist and entrepreneur Alexander Osterwalder. The canvas is based on his 2005 research work -[ The Business Model Ontology: A proposition in a design science ](http://www.hec.unil.ch/aosterwa/PhD/Osterwalder_PhD_BM_Ontology.pdf)approach presented at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.

 The nine blocks cover the three main areas of a business: desirability, viability and feasibility. The business model is like a blueprint for a strategy to be implemented through organizational structures, processes, and systems.
