**The Bank of America Institute for Women’s Entrepreneurship at Cornell** is a collaboration between Bank of America and Cornell University to deliver an online learning portal that provides women entrepreneurs with the skills, knowledge and resources to build, manage, and scale a successful business.

The new institute draws on the expertise of faculty from Cornell Law School, Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management, Entrepreneurship at Cornell and eCornell, among others.

Eligibility Requirements

The program targets women who are starting, running, or expanding a business. 

Participants should be past the stage of early brainstorming, should have taken some initial steps towards focusing on a particular context and should have assembled at least modest levels of human and capital resources. \
\
There is not a strict guideline regarding years of operation, but a rough guideline is 0-5 years. 

For companies operating with more years of experience, the curriculum may still be useful if the business is in the process of reinvigoration or is launching an entrepreneurial initiative.

Entrepreneurs from all industries are eligible.

Social innovators are welcome, but they ideally are seeking to build a financially sustainable business. Although not-for-profit entrepreneurs can benefit from the curriculum, the legal and financial courses are focused on for-profit businesses.

The program welcome participants from diverse industries, nationalities, and geographies, and we encourage applicants of all ages, gender identities, races, ethnicities, cultures, sexual orientation, or other dimensions of diversity.
