**The BlackBerry IVY L-SPARK Accelerator Program** is looking for innovative Canadian companies with technologies that align with BlackBerry’s Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform – [BlackBerry IVY](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/automotive/blackberry-ivy). Participants will develop high-impact solutions leveraging in-vehicle data with a view to improving driver and passenger experiences.

BlackBerry IVY is a vehicle first, cloud connected software platform that presents vehicle data in a normalized format. BlackBerry IVY insights can easily be consumed by applications on or off the vehicle and are managed via a cloud console. 

Benefits

### Partnership

Participants will have the opportunity to develop technology and business relationships with BlackBerry, the company that has the most widely embedded OS in vehicles globally.

### Access to BlackBerry IVY

Participants will have access to BlackBerry IVY to build applications based on vehicle sensor data, without the need for specialized embedded or automotive software skills.

### L-SPARK Mentorship

Each participant will be supported by a dedicated L-SPARK mentor who will work hands-on to guide the company in implementing their solution and provide business mentorship to accelerate growth.

### Funding

Up to $50,000 in matching funding will be made available to participants through NRC-IRAP.
