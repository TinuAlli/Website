Canada Summer Jobs is a program under the Youth Employment and Skills Strategy, which aims to provide flexible and holistic services to help all young Canadians develop the skills and gain paid work experience to successfully transition into the labour market.

The CSJ program objectives align with the redesigned Youth Employment and Skills Strategy and are as follows:

* provide quality work experiences for youth
* respond to national and local priorities to improve access to the labour market for youth who face unique barriers
* provide opportunities for youth to develop and improve their skills

The program provides wage subsidies to employers from not-for-profit organizations, the public sector, and private sector organizations with 50 or fewer full-time employees, to create quality summer work experiences for young people aged 15 to 30 years.

The Government has committed to create 100,000 CSJ jobs for youth in 2022 to help ensure that the program remains responsive to the employment needs of youth and employers. For 2022, CSJ is returning to its regular parameters and will offer quality jobs over the summer months. The jobs will need to end by September 3, 2022. Jobs will need to be full time with a minimum of 30 hours a week and a duration of at least 6 weeks.

In the context of COVID-19, employers are responsible for ensuring health and safety measures are in place and are in accordance with municipal, provincial and federal public health guidance.
