The Snapchat 523 Accelerator program is designed to support and spotlight small, minority-owned* content companies and creatives that traditionally lack access and resources — particularly when compared to larger competitors and publishers. The goal is to help them build their businesses and audiences through the creation of Shows for Discover.

* Have less than 20 full-time employees
