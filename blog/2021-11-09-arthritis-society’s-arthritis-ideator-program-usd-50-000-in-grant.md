The Arthritis Ideator Program is an integral part of the Arthritis Society’s bold innovation strategy.  Arthritis Society is committed to identifying and partnering with leading ideators and innovators who are working on solutions to improve the lives of people with arthritis.



The Arthritis Society invite ideators, entrepreneurs and start-ups across Canada to submit innovative ideas that will help us fight the fire of arthritis.

Ideas and innovations might include, for example:

* assistive devices for aiding mobility or making the activities of daily living easier for people with arthritis
* technology that can help manage the disease better
* an application that helps people monitor symptoms

An expert panel will select eight finalists from among the applications to present their innovative ideas to a five-person panel of judges comprised of one Arthritis Society representative and four VIP representatives. 



The top three projects selected by the panel at the **Arthritis Ideation DenTM event** will each receive a $50,000 prize. A People’s Choice Award of $50,000 will also be selected from among the remaining finalists. 

### **Key Dates** 

December 21, 2021 – Submissions close \
March 3, 2022 – 8 finalists announced \
