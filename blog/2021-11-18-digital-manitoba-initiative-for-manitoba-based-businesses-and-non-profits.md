With an investment of $15 Million provided by[ the Province of Manitoba](https://news.gov.mb.ca/news/?archive=&item=52736) and managed by the [Manitoba Chambers of Commerce](https://mbchamber.mb.ca/), the Digital Manitoba Initiative was created to ensure local businesses have the tools they need to take advantage of opportunities provided by the modern economy. 

To stay competitive, businesses must invest in their digital assets, upgrade their outdated or inefficient systems and adapt their strategies for everything from marketing to supply chain, to customer experience. Digital adaptation can feel like a threat, but it also represents a huge opportunity. Now businesses can not only meet, but personalize, predict, and even influence the needs of their customers, creating more valuable interactions, and in turn, more meaningful relationships. And when local business thrives, the entire province benefits!
