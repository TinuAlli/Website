The City of Edmonton is applications for its Individual Business Grants program (City Stream).

Eligible businesses can apply for an Individual Business Grant through one, or both, of the following components:

1. **Local Economic Conditions Component**: For urgent needs to help individual businesses quickly recover from COVID-19 impacts. Most microgrants will be $1,000. **For reference**, if a business has received an Individual Business Grant before October 5, 2021, it will have received funding through this Component.
2. **Restrictions Exemption Program Component**: For businesses that are in-scope to participate in the Restrictions Exemption Program Component. Funding is available to support the costs incurred by individual businesses in their administration of the [Provincial Restrictions Exemption Program](https://www.alberta.ca/covid-19-public-health-actions.aspx?utm_source=google&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=Covid19&utm_term=REP&utm_content=REP1&gclid=CjwKCAjwzOqKBhAWEiwArQGwaBHQLQVAZbMkU3ca-bklLEK2jwKP2LcIyQ4_1ewcYisqQSI2YwmsTRoCaqEQAvD_BwE#REP). Microgrants will be $1,000.

Businesses are only able to obtain a maximum of one $1,000 matching grant under the Local Economic Conditions Component, and a maximum of one $1,000 matching grant under the Restrictions Exemption Program Component. For clarity, an eligible local business that previously received a $1,000 Individual Business Grant, may apply for and potentially receive an additional $1,000 matching grant from the Restrictions Exemption Program Component.
