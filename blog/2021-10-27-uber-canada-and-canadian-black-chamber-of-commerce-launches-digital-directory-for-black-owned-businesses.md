Uber Canada and Canadian Black Chamber of Commerce have announced the launch of Black Business Direct, a canadian-wide digital directory for Black-owned businesses.



The CBCC is launching **“Black Business Direct”— the first national digital directory for Black-owned small businesses** from coast to coast to coast. **Black Business Direct** provides a platform for businesses and the community to find black-owned businesses directly. The service will be free to join—and free to view, ensuring Canadians have a single online source to help them easily discover and support new Black-owned restaurants, retail shops, vendors, and entrepreneurs.
