The Alberta Jobs Now program will provide up to $370 million to help private and non-profit businesses with job supports to get thousands of Albertans back to work.

Employers can apply for funding to offset the cost of hiring and training Albertans in new or vacant positions.



## Improvements to Alberta Jobs Now program

A number of improvements have also been made for the second intake to the Alberta Jobs Now program to help more businesses grow and get more Albertans back to work as our economy recovers:

* New businesses and organizations established within the last year can now apply to the program to support further job-creating investment.
* The minimum number of average hours a person must work under the program has been reduced from 30 to 15 hours per week.
*  Employers can apply for up to 10 new hires to help more businesses access funding through the program.

  * On a case-by-case basis, employers may receive an exemption for up to 20 new hires if they can demonstrate substantial need. Contact [jnp@gov.ab.ca](mailto:jnp@gov.ab.ca) for more information.
* Employers now have up to 90 days to recruit for approved positions under the program.
* While the focus of the program is to support the hiring of unemployed and underemployed Albertans, employers may fill available positions with employed Albertans if there is a business need.

### Intake 2 – Eligible new hires

New hires are eligible for the second application intake period if they were hired on or after May 19, 2021 (program announcement), and meet all other eligibility criteria.

## Funding

Private sector businesses and non-profit organizations across all industries can apply for funding to reduce the costs of hiring and training Albertans. Additional funding is available for hiring persons with disabilities.

Employers can:

* apply for a grant to offset salary or training costs, or both, equal to:

  * 25% of a new hire’s salary up to $25,000 per employee
  * 37.5% of the new hire's salary up to $37,500 per employee with a disability
* apply for up to 10 new hires for the second intake:

  * first intake: May 20 to July 23, 2021
  * second intake:  November 10 until funding is allocated.
  * third intake: to be announced at a later date
* choose to have payments issued in 1 or 2 payments:

  * 1 payment: up to 100% of the grant after new hires have been employed for 52 weeks
  * 2 payments:

    * half of the eligible grant paid when the new hires have been employed for 3 months
    * the other half paid when the new hires have been employed for 52 weeks
    * New businesses and organizations established within 6 months prior to application will receive 25% of funding at 3 months and 75% at 52 weeks.

## Eligibility

Private sector businesses and non-profit organizations in Alberta can apply.

Applications will be assessed on a first come, first served basis.

## Benefit to Albertans

### Employers

Employers can apply to the Albertan Jobs Now program to cover wages or training costs of hiring workers in new or vacant positions. This funding will help employers re-open or expand their operations.

### Unemployed or underemployed

If you are unemployed or underemployed and looking for a new job, let potential employers know they can apply for the Alberta Jobs Now program to cover wages and training costs if they hire you. Workers cannot apply for the program directly.

### Albertans with disabilities

Employers who hire persons with disabilities will receive a grant 1.5 times higher than the amount they would receive for other employees. If you have a disability and are looking for work, you can let employers know they can receive extra grant money through the Alberta Jobs Now Program if they hire you.
