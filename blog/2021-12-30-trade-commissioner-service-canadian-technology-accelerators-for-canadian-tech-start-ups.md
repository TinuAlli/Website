**The Canadian Technology Accelerators (CTA)** empower high potential Canadian technology companies that offer a market-ready technology or product to explore opportunities for global growth. We help companies in three main sectors of activity:

* clean technologies
* digital industries and information and communications technologies (ICT)
* life sciences and digital health

Established in 2013, the Canadian Technology Accelerator is a global business development program offered by the Canadian Trade Commissioner Service.

* Boston
* New York
* San Francisco
* Silicon Valley
* Mexico
* Berlin; Munich
* UK
* Hong Kong
* Taipei
* Tokyo
* Singapore
* India
* More soon

ATCs adapt and develop according to market demands in order to provide participants with the most relevant and effective support possible. There is no cost to participate in the ATC program other than travel and accommodation costs.

## Eligibility

CTAs are open to innovative Canadian tech companies that can demonstrate:

* **Traction in the Marketplace:** You have at least a minimum viable product (MVP), along with quantifiable evidence of maturity (revenue, investment, or number of users). **Life Sciences and Health companies** must have a proof of concept and be post-seed.
* **Product Market Fit:** You can define your target audience, articulate the problem you solve, and demonstrate differentiation of your product/service.
* **Strong & Experienced Executive Management Team:** You can commit to send at least one senior member (C-level or Founder) to take part in the program and have the financial resources to cover in-market costs.
* **Potential to Scale:** You have a well thought out go-to-market plan for the CTA location along with KPIs to match.

## Benefits

Although ATCs vary in length and format (virtual or in-market), all participating companies benefit from the following:

* access to an extensive network of trade commissioners;
* coaching and mentoring from industry leaders;
* help to improve their international trade and market entry strategies;
* putting in contact with potential customers and partners;
* connecting with investors and venture capitalists;
* a collaborative workspace (if available).
