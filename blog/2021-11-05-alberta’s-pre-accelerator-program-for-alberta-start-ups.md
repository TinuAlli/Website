In partnership with Alberta Innovates, Alberta’s pre-accelerator is being developed and delivered by Platform Calgary and Innovate Edmonton, with support from partners and organizations in all eight regions across the Alberta Innovation Network.



Alberta’s pre-accelerator is a merit-based program series supporting founders and their start-ups anywhere in Alberta. Divided into three phases, the program will launch later this year and is an unprecedented realignment, harmonization and expansion of start-up support in the province.

The Approach

Alberta’s pre-accelerator will deliver business supports and advice to qualified founders, entrepreneurs and start-ups in the early stages of development, preparing them to advance to the scale-up and acceleration stages. With a focus on equity, diversity and inclusion, Alberta’s pre-accelerator will feature coaches and mentors who reflect the diversity of Alberta’s population, and will ensure advocacy and support for previously underserved tech-founder communities
