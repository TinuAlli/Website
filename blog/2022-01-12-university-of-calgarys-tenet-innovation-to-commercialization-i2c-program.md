The TENET i2c program provides funding and training to University of Calgary researchers, clinicians, postdocs, graduate students, and staff to transform their health research into a commercial product or service.  

Participants receive entrepreneurial training and coaching from the Hunter Hub and are matched with mentors from the greater innovation community. These resources equip participants with the knowledge and skills to pitch their ideas at a final competition at Inventures for a chance to win up to $100,000 to commercialize their product.  

TENET i2c is led by the Hunter Hub for Entrepreneurial Thinking and is made possible thanks to a generous donation from Ken Moore, former president of TENET Biomedical Engineering (1994-2011).
