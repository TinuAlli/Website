Supply Chain AI at MaRS is a program housed at MaRS Discovery District, in partnership with Scale AI. [Scale AI](https://www.scaleai.ca/) is a program stemming from the [AI-Powered Supply Chains Supercluster](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/093.nsf/eng/00009.html), created in partnership with the Government of Canada. It aims to support the emergence and acceleration of high-potential, Canadian venture companies that are focused on building applied AI and intelligent supply chain products and services, with the objective of fostering emerging global leaders.\
\
The Supply Chain AI program at MaRS supports a cohort of up to 12 eligible venture companies applying AI to supply chains, providing them with hands-on advice, mentorship, market insights and subject matter expertise, along with marketing opportunities and critical connections to capital, talent and customers.
