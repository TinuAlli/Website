An abundance of data shows that Black Canadians have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic in economic terms, both in terms of employment and entrepreneurship. Even before the onset of COVID-19, minority and newcomer populations faced structural barriers when starting a small business or pursuing self-employment. These obstacles include access to capital and networks, as well as skills gaps. 



**The Black African and Caribbean Entrepreneurship Leadership (BACEL) Training Program** aims to train 400 Black entrepreneurs over a 20-month period, providing access to skills, in tandem with other supports and approaches, to address barriers. Led by the [Black Business and Professional Association](https://bbpa.org/) (BBPA), this initiative will build on the success of the BBPA’s existing complement of programming, and, through rigorous evaluation, demonstrate the economic opportunity that can be gained from the delivery of culturally appropriate entrepreneurial skills training to marginalized communities. 



The Future Skills Centre is investing $1.5 million in this two-year project, called the Black African and Caribbean Entrepreneurship Leadership (BACEL) Training Program. These efforts will gather impact data and survey metrics around pre-and post-program skills and produce a final report on findings. In collaboration with the [Diversity Institute](https://fsc-ccf.ca/partner/diversity-institute/) and community partners, the project will develop a robust entrepreneurship training and skills development program with courses that aim to close the gaps and assist Black entrepreneurs in overcoming challenges to business growth and success. 

BACEL participants will have the opportunity to develop their entrepreneurial skills, build their community and networks, and receive the support they need to succeed—all at no cost. 

Requirements

* This training program is open to all Black entrepreneurs of all backgrounds, demographics, genders and capabilities.
* BACEL is open to Black entrepreneurs 18 years of age or older; however, some programs are open to younger participants.
* There are no business requirements except the desire to gain additional knowledge and training.

Program Structure

Every participant must complete BACEL’s core course component before entering a specialized stream (for example: arts, tech, service industry).

BACEL will include coursework, mentoring, advising and supports. Over the course of the 20 months there may be opportunities for participants to use their skills through internship or volunteering.

\
To start, BACEL will be offered as an online training course so the need for differently abled supports will be minimal. If we move to that combined online/classroom delivery model, we will take all necessary steps to ensure differently abled supports are in place.
