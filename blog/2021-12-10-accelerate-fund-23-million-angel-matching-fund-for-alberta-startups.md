Are you an Alberta tech startup seeking early-stage capital for growth, but not yet VC-round ready? Accelerate Fund provides a source of funding as a first step in preparing for VC funding in the future upon execution of your business.

Accelerate Fund invest in tech startups that are private, incorporated, and have a head office and more than 50% of employees located in Alberta. Typically, Accelerate Fund focus on information and communications technology, energy technology, life sciences, agriculture and biotech. The $10-million Accelerate Fund I and Fund II are fully invested.

Requirements

* Incorporated, private technology startup companies with a head office and more than 50% of employees located in Alberta.
* Product-based companies with proprietary technology/process and/or patents (awarded or filed).
* Companies in a technology sector including but not limited to information and communications technology, clean and energy technology, as well as life sciences, including agriculture and biotech.
* Companies who have committed investors to co-invest with Accelerate Fund.
* Companies (that have a confirmed angel investor) or their angel investors may submit a pitch form to the Accelerate Fund.



The Accelerate Fund will always seek to maximize the leverage of its capital and to bring in multiple angels to the financing. For example, an ideal situation might involve a company that has three angels investing $250,000 each, but has a need for an additional $250,000. The Accelerate Fund could provide the additional $250,000 thus seeing leverage of four times its investment.



Co-Investment Requirement

* Equity financing rounds with super angels and individual angel investors.
* Investment from angel groups and/or family funds.
* Convertible debt.
* The angel round under consideration may include investment of up to 50% from the company management (also included, friends and family of the management).
