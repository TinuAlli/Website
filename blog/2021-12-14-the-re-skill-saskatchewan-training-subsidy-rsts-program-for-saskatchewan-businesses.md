**The Re-Skill Saskatchewan Training Subsidy (RSTS) program** is a new, temporary program that provides businesses with the financial support to train employees as the province emerges from the pandemic and economic recovery. This program supports eligible Saskatchewan employers to access financial supports for employer-driven, short term training programs for their employees.

Funding to support training can help employers evolve from the impacts of the pandemic into economic recovery.

The objectives of the RSTS are to:

* support employers in meeting the challenges brought on by COVID-19,
* provide enhanced training support to ensure employers are able to access training to sustain business activities while stimulating competitiveness;
* reduce obstacles to hiring, retraining and retaining workers to boost the province's economic recovery.

Eligibility

### **Employers**

Private and not-for-profit sector employers are eligible.

Publicly funded organizations such as health regions, post-secondary training institutions, public libraries, municipalities and school divisions are not eligible for funding.

### Trainees

Eligible trainees are required to be:

* a Canadian citizen or permanent resident with a valid Social Insurance Number; and
* an existing employee of the applying employer (that is currently on the payroll of the company).

Temporary Foreign Workers and volunteers are not eligible for training funding. Saskatchewan-based owners of small businesses (with 1-50 employees) may also participate in funded training with their employees.



### Training Costs

* Tuition fees or fees charged by the training provider;
* Mandatory student fees;
* Textbooks, software and other required materials;
* Learning material fees; and
* Examination fees.

### Training

Training is flexible. Employers choose the training program and mode of delivery that will meet their needs within the following requirements:

* Must be delivered by a Saskatchewan-based third-party that has been in business for one year and is not affiliated with the employer;
* Must be a minimum of 8 hours in length per trainee by the same training provider and completed within 4 months;
* Must start within 4 months of the application date;
* Must result in a credential (record of completion, certificate, grade, etc.).

### Training Providers

Third-party training providers are required to be based in Saskatchewan and have been in business for one year. This could include:

* Post-secondary education institutions;
* Private vocational schools; or
* Private industry trainers.

Benefits

* Financial supports can ensure employers have access to training that supports their business recovery efforts and assists them in meeting the challenges brought on by COVID-19;
* Employers select the employee(s) and the training program;
* 100% reimbursement is provided to eligible employers for approved training costs; and
* **Payment is made to approved employers that enter into a training agreement with the government and completion of final reporting, including verification of actual expenditures.**

Employers can make multiple applications to a maximum of $5,000 for the duration of the program. The minimum amount per application is $1,000 per training program. Employers may work with training providers to combine courses into customized programs that meet their training needs.

How to Apply

**The Re-Skill Saskatchewan Training Subsidy applications will be open starting January 4, 2022.**
