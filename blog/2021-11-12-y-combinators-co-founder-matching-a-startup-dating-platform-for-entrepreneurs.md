Now, if you are well-versed in the startup business, you must have heard about Y Combinator. Likewise, if you are new, you are wondering, *" What is Y Combinator?"*

Y Combinator is an American technology startup accelerator launched in 2005 by Paul Graham, Jessica Livingstone, Robert Morris, and Trevor Blackwell. With Y Combinator's motto being, "Make Something People Want", the  program teaches startup founders how to scale their business to a high growth business amongst other workshops held. The founders receive funding and connections in exchange for a percentage equity of their company. YC has been used to launch over 3000 companies including popular companies such as Reddit, Doordash, Instacart, Airbnb etc.

Taking it a step further, YC has launched a startup dating platform for entrepreneurs, Co-founder Matching. Co-founder Matching serves as a platform for entrepreneurs to meet other entrepreneurs with the goal of creating a startup, so think, **like tinder is to dating for love, co-founder matching is to dating for startup**. *Isn't that cool?!*

To join Co-founder Matching, one would already have to have an account with Y Combinator and then you are moved to the sign-up portal for YC Startup School. Co-founder Matching is an incentive added for participants of the YC Startup School and then there are additional features for participants with an active startup to help their productivity. 

**The catch** is an entrepreneur does not have to have an idea to be given access to Co-founder Matching, you can choose to meet someone who has an idea already. So, *Entrepreneurs?* Go ye into world and multiply your startups!
